/**
 * This class was copied from the old RabbitMQ connector. A serializable {@link ReturnListener} to
 * handle unroutable but "mandatory" messages.
 *
 * <p>If a message has the "mandatory" flag set, but cannot be routed, RabbitMQ's broker will return
 * the message to the publishing client (via an AMQP.Basic.Return command). This ReturnListener
 * implements a callback handler to get notified in such returns and act on these messages as
 * wanted.
